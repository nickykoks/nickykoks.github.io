					<h1>Arthur story</h1>
					
					<h2 id="h2-1-1">Heading 1</h2>
				
					<img class="pic-right-side" src="otherimg/pic1.jpg"><p>In ancient days there lived a very noble King, named Uther-Pendragon, and he became Overlord of all of Britain. 
					This King was very greatly aided into the achievement of the Pendragonship of the realm by the help of two men, who rendered him great assistance in all that he did. 
					The one of these men was a certain very powerful enchanter and sometime prophet known to men as Merlin the Wise; and he gave very good counsel unto Uther-Pendragon.  
					The other man was an excellent noble and renowned knight, hight Ulfius (who was thought by many to be the greatest leader in war of any man then alive),
					and he gave Uther-Pendragon aid and advice in battle.
					So, with the help of Merlin and Sir Ulfius, Uther-Pendragon was able to overcome all of his enemies and to become King of the entire realm.</p>
					
					<img class="pic-left-side" src="otherimg/pic2.jpg">
					<p>After Uther-Pendragon had ruled his kingdom for a number of years he took to wife a certain beautiful and gentle lady, hight Igraine.
					This noble dame was the widow of Gerlois, the Duke of Tintegal; -by which prince she had two daughters-one of whom was named Margaise and the other Morgana le Fay.
					Morgana le Fay was a famous sorceress.
					These daughters the Queen brought with her to the Court of Uther-Pendragon after she had married that puissant King 
					and there Margaise was wedded to King Urien of Gore and Morgana le Fay was wedded to King Lot of Orkney.</p>
		
					<img class="pic-right-side" src="otherimg/pic3.jpg"><p>Now after awhile Uther-Pendragon and Queen Igraine had a son born unto them and he was very beautiful and of great size and strength of bone.
					While the child still lay wrapped in his swaddling clothes and lying in a cradle of gold and ultramarine, 
					Merlin came to Uther-Pendragon with a spirit of prophecy strong upon him 
					(for such was often the case with him) and speaking in that spirit of prophecy, he said: “Lord, it is given unto me to foresee that thou shalt shortly fall sick of a fever 
					and that thou shalt maybe die of a violent sweat that will follow thereon.
					Now, should such a dolorous thing be fall us all, this young child 
					(who is, certes, the hope of all this realm) will be in very great danger of his life. For many enemies will assuredly rise up with design to seize upon him for the sake of his inheritance
					and either he will be slain or else he will be held in captivity from which he shall hardly hope to escape.
					Wherefore, I do beseech thee, Lord, that thou wilt permit Sir Ulfius and myself to presently convey the child away unto some place of safe refuge,
					where he may be hidden in secret until he groweth to manhood and is able to guard himself from such dangers as may threaten him.”</p>
					
					<h2 id="h2-1-2">Heading 2</h2>
					
					<p>When Merlin had made an end of speaking thus, Uther-Pendragon made reply with a very steadfast countenance in this wise: “Merlin, so far as my death is concerned-when my time cometh to die I believe God will give me grace to meet my end with entire cheerfulness;
					for, certes, my lot is in that wise no different from that of any other man who hath been born of woman. But touching the matter of this young child, if thy prophecy be true,
					then his danger is very great, and it would be well that he should be conveyed hence to some place of safe harborage as thou dost advise.
					Wherefore, I pray thee to perform thy will in this affair, bearing in thy heart the consideration that the child is the most precious inheritance which I shall leave unto this land.”</p>
					
					<p>All this, as was said, Uther-Pendragon spake with great calmness and equanimity of spirit.
					And Merlin did as he had advised, and he and Sir Ulfius conveyed the child away by night, and no one but they wist whither the babe had been taken.
					And shortly afterward Uther-Pendragon was seized with the sickness as Merlin had foretold, and he died exactly as Merlin had feared that he would die;
					wherefore it was very well that the child had been taken to a place of safety.</p>
					
					<h2 id="h2-1-3">Heading 3</h2>
					
					<img class="pic-left-side" src="otherimg/pic4.jpg"><p>And after Uther-Pendragon had departed from this life, it was like-wise as Merlin had feared, for all the realm fell into great disorder.
					For each lesser king contended against his fellow for overlordship, and wicked knights and barons harried the highways as they listed and there levied toll with great cruelty upon helpless wayfarers.
					For some such travellers they took prisoners and held for ransom, whiles others they slew because they had no ransom to pay.
					So it was a very common sight to see a dead man lying by the roadside, if you should venture to make a journey upon some business or other.
					Thus it befell that, after awhile, all that dolorous land groaned with the trouble that lay upon it.</p>
					
					<p>Thus there passed nearly eighteen years in such great affliction, and then one day the Archbishop of Canterbury summoned Merlin to him and bespake him in this wise:
					“Merlin, men say that thou art the wisest man in all the world.
					Canst thou not find some means to heal the distractions of this woeful realm? Bend thou thy wisdom to this matter and choose thou a king who shall be a fit overlord for us, 
					so that we may enjoy happiness of life once more as we did in the days of Uther-Pendragon.”</p>
					
					<p>Then Merlin lifted up his countenance upon the Archbishop, and spake in this wise:
					“My lord, the spirit of prophecy that lieth upon me sometimes moveth me now to say that I do perceive that this country is soon to have a king who shall be wiser and greater and more worthy of praise than was even Uther-Pendragon."
					He shall bring order and peace where is now disorder and war.
					Moreover, I may tell you that this King shall be of Uther-Pendragon's own full blood-royal.”</p>
					
					<h2 id="h2-1-4">Heading 4</h2>
					
					<p>To this the Archbishop said: “What thou tellest me, Merlin, is a wonderfully strange thing. 
					But in this spirit of prophecy canst thou not foretell when this King is to come? 
					And canst thou tell how we shall know him when he appeareth amongst us?
					For many lesser kings there are who would fain be overlord of this land, and many such there are who deem themselves fit to rule over all the others.
					How then shall we know the real King from those who may proclaim themselves to be the rightful king?”</p>
					
					<p>“My lord Archbishop,” quoth Merlin, “if I have thy leave for to exert my magic I shall set an adventure which, if any man achieve it, all the world shall straightway know that he is the rightful King and overlord of this realm.” 
					And to this the Archbishop said: “Merlin, I bid thee do whatsoever may seem to thee to be right in this affair.”
					And Merlin said: “I will do so.”</p>
					
					<img class="pic-right-side" src="otherimg/pic5.jpg"><p>So Merlin caused by magic that a huge marble stone, four square, should suddenly appear in an open place before the cathedral door. 
					Upon this block of marble he caused it to be that there should stand an anvil and into the anvil he caused it that there should be thrust a great naked sword midway deep of the blade.
					This sword was the most wonderful that any man had ever seen, for the blade was of blue steel and extraordinarily bright and glistering.
					The hilt was of gold, chased and carved with marvellous cunning, and inlaid with a great number of precious stones, so that it shone with wonderful brightness in the sunlight.
					And about the sword were written these words in letters of gold:- “Whoso Pulleth Out this Sword from the Anvil That same is Rightwise King- Born of England.”</p>
					
					<p>So a great many people came and gazed upon that sword and marvelled at it exceedingly, for its like had never before been beheld upon the earth.</p>
					
					<p>Then, when Merlin had accomplished this miracle, he bade the Arch-bishop to call together all the chief people of that land upon Christmastide.
					And he bade the Archbishop to command that every man should make assay to draw out the sword, for that he who should succeed in drawing it forth out of the anvil should be rightwise King of Britain.</p>
					
					<p>So the Archbishop did according as Merlin said; and this was the marvel of the marble stone and the anvil, of which same anyone may easily read for himself in that book written a very long while ago by Robert de Boron, which is called Le Roman de Merlin.</p>
					
					<p>Now when the mandate of the Lord Archbishop went forth, summoning all the chief people of the land to the assay of that miracle 
					(for, indeed, it was a miracle to draw forth a sword-blade out of an anvil of solid iron), all the realm became immediately cast into a great ferment, so that each man asked his fellow,
					“Who shall draw forth that sword, and who shall be our King?” 
					Some thought it would be King Lot and others thought it would be King Urien of Gore (these being the sons-in-law unto Uther-Pendragon);
					some thought that it would be King Leodegrance of Camiliard, and others that it would be King Ryence of North Wales; 
					some thought it would be this king and others that it would be that king; for all the world was divided into different parties who thought according to their liking.</p>
					
					<p>Then, as Christmastide drew nigh, it presently appeared as though the entire world was wending its way to London Town, for the highways and the by-ways became filled with wayfarers
					- kings and lords and knights and ladies and esquires and pages and men-at-arms - all betaking their way whither the assay was to be made of that adventure of the sword and the anvil.
					Every inn and castle was filled so full of travellers that it was a marvel how so many folk could be contained within their compass,
					and everywhere were tents and pavilions pitched along the wayside for the accommodation of those who could not find shelter within doors.</p>
					
					<p>But when the Archbishop beheld the multitudes that were assembling, he said to Merlin, “Indeed, Merlin, it would be a very singular thing if among all these great kings and noble,
					honorable lords we should not find some one worthy of being the King of this realm.”</p>
					
					<p>Unto which the Merlin smiled and said, “Marvel not, my lord, if among all those who appear to be so extraordinarily worthy there shall not be found one who is worthy;
					and marvel not if, among all those who are unknown, there shall arise one who shall approve himself to be entirely worthy. ”And the Archbishop pondered Merlin's words, and so beginneth this story.</p>

					<h1>Myths and Facts</h1>
					<p>Who was King Arthur? Was there really a sword in the stone? Or a Round Table? What about the Lady of the Lake? Here are 11 fabulous facts about the Once and Future King…</p>
					
					<h2 id="h2-2-1">The real King Arthur</h2>
					<p>There almost certainly was an Arthur – but sadly it was unlikely he was a king. The writings of ninth-century Welsh monk Nennius first refer to Arthur as a fifth-century warrior leading a band of men fighting the invading Saxons – in this sense making him far more like the battling hero of Arthur: Legend of the Sword who learns to fight on the mean streets than the courtly knight of legend.</p>
					
					<h2 id="h2-2-1">The start of the legend</h2>
					<p>Three hundred years later, Arthur got a major promotion, when Geoffrey of Monmouth wrote his masterpiece A History of the Kings of Britain. He made Arthur a King who defeated the Saxons and united England, as well as first introducing the magician Merlin and Arthur’s nemesis Mordred. The story became a sensation across Europe and over the next centuries was added to and expanded to include the sword in the stone, the quest for the Holy Grail and all the other elements we know today.</p>
					
					<h2 id="h2-2-1">Merlin</h2>
					<p>First created by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Merlin the magician has become inseparable from Arthur himself. Guy Ritchie has him as a mysterious, mostly hinted-at figure pulling the strings behind the scenes – which is actually truer to Geoffrey’s original vision than the “right-hand man” he became in later tales. Geoffrey’s Merlin was a combination of several historical and mythical figures, most notably the Welsh prophet Myrddin Wyllt and the Romano-British leader Ambrosius Aurelanius. The result was Merlin Ambrosius, part madman, part magician, part guardian of Albion.
					</p>
					
					<h2 id="h2-2-1">The Sword in the Stone – version 1</h2>
					<p>The drawing of Excalibur from the stone, thus proving Arthur to be the true king, is one of the most famous of the Arthurian legends. In King Arthur: Legend of the Sword it shows Arthur to be Uther’s son and the only man able to defeat the evil Vortigern. But did it really happen? Well… sort of. There is an ancient stone thought to date back to at least the Romans at the Museum of London (known as “The London Stone”) which a new King would strike with his sword to declare his right to rule…</p>
					
					<h2 id="h2-2-1">The Sword in the Stone – version 2</h2>
					<p>Another theory has the sword in the stone myth coming down to an error in the translation of the ancient stories. The Latin word for stone is “saxum”: could it be that Arthur, as the leader who fought the invading Saxons, was originally dubbed “the sword in the Saxons”… which simply got later mistranslated to the “sword in the saxum”?</p>
